## Task:
- Cover Unit and Integration tests with 80-90% of the code

### Technical details:
- Unit and Integration tests should be run in different phases of the life cycle
- To implement Integration tests, you must inherit from the IntegrationTestBase class
- Remember about the correct naming of Unit and Integration tests (both classes and methods)
- To check the percentage of test coverage, you can use the jacoco plugin, or IntelliJ IDEA tools (Run with Coverage)
